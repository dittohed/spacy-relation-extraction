Food-disease(like) reliations occurences with context:

We examined associations between adolescent diet quality and depressive symptoms

a negative association between fruit and vegetable intake and MFQ score was seen

Fish intake and MDS were not cross-sectionally associated with MFQ score

No prospective associations were found between MDS, fruit and vegetable intake or fish intake and later MFQ score

Diet quality was not associated with depressive symptoms

healthy diet in adulthood is associated with a reduced risk of depression

adherence to a Mediterranean diet (characterized by higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and monounsaturated fats, and lower intakes of red and processed meats and alcohol)( 5 ), fruit and vegetable intake( 6 ) and fish intake( 7 ) have all been associated with reduced risk of depression in adults

Increased adiposity, frequently associated with poor quality of diet, has been associated with increased risk of depression

certain inflammatory markers have been associated with increased risk of depression

higher diet quality has been directly associated with lower concentrations of inflammatory markers

Studies of associations between diet and depression in adolescence

reviews addressed the relationship between diet and depression in adolescents

support for an association between a healthy diet and lower levels of depression

negative associations between diet quality and measures of mental health related to depression

better understanding of the associations between diet and depression in adolescence

associations of intake of fruit and vegetables( 6 ) and intake of fish( 7 ) with depressive symptoms in this cohort

association between diet quality (MDS, fruit and vegetables, fish) at age 14 years and development of depressive symptoms

test associations between dietary variables and depressive symptoms

X associations between MDS, fruit and vegetable intake and fish intake and depressive symptoms are shown

There were no significant associations between diet quality (MDS), fruit and vegetable intake or fish intake and depressive symptoms at baseline

Cross-sectional associations between fruit and vegetable consumption and depressive symptoms were seen

studies assessing relationships between diet and depression
