Food occurences with context:

Diet data were processed to derive a Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and daily servings of fruit and vegetables, and fish.

adjustment for behavioural covariates, including smoking and alcohol consumption, attenuated this association

Fish intake and MDS were not cross-sectionally associated with MFQ score.

No prospective associations were found between MDS, fruit and vegetable intake or fish intake.

In particular, adherence to a Mediterranean diet (characterized by higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and monounsaturated fats, and lower intakes of red and processed meats and alcohol)(5), fruit and vegetable intake (6) and fish intake (7) have all been associated with reduced risk of depression in adults.
