Food-disease(like) reliations occurences with context:

More frequent consumption of homecooked meals was associated with greater likelihood of having normal range BMI and normal percentage body fat.

eating home cooked meals more frequently was associatedwith better dietary quality and lower adiposity

consumption of home cooked meals has causal effects on diet and health

we hypothesised that eating home cooked meals more frequently would be associated with markers of a healthier diet and improved cardio-metabolic health

study investigating interactions between genetic and lifestyle factors

The consumption of a more DASH accordant diet isassociated with positive health indicators and loweredcardio-metabolic risk

Concordance with the Mediterranean diet has been linked with positive health outcomes

Elevated total cholesterol and low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease

Excess body fat and raised BMI have been associated withincreased risk of various NCDs

Hypertension is associated with an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease

Multivariate associations between the frequency of consuming home cooked meals and indicators of diet quality and cardiometabolic status

consuming home cooked meals more than five times per week compared with the reference was associated with improved adiposity

higher frequency of consuming home cooked meals was associated with markers of improved cardio-metabolic health, including lower risk cholesterol ratio, normal range BMI, lower percentage body fat, and lower risk of diabetes according to HbA1clevel.

Higher frequency of consuming home cooked main meals was significantly associated with indicators of a healthier diet, namely DASH score, MDS, plasma vitamin C, fruit intake and vegetable intake

eating home cooked meals more frequently was significantly associated with several markers of cardio-metabolic health, including lower likelihood of having an overweight BMI, and lower likelihood of excess percentage body fat

Associations between frequency of homecooked meal consumption and markers of cardio-metabolic health were strongest at the highest consumption frequency of eating meals more

associations between consuming home cooked meals more frequently and higher diet quality

relationships between consuming homecooked meals, diet quality, and cardio-metabolic health, vary between countries
