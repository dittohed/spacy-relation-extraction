Food occurences with context:

Compared with food-secure students, food insecure students eat fewer fruits, vegetables, and legumes [23], consume more processed meals

eating less than 2 cups of fruits and/or less than 3 cups of vegetables as measured

Among the 4630 students, 86.5% (n = 4007) had less than optimal fruit and vegetable consumption 

highly related as meal plan enrollment is generally required among students residing on-campus but not for those off-campus

In fact, food pantry users prefer and need fresh produce, dairy products, eggs, and meat above the canned food provided in the emergency food systems
