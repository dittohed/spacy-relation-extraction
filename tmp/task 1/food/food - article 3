Food occurences with context:

and changes in consumption of fruit, vegetables, confectionery and sugar-sweetened beverages

between availability of particular foods (e.g. fruit and vegetables and soft drinks)

Four questions assessed frequency of consumption of fruit, vegetables, sweets/chocolate and sugar-containing soft drinks, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) study

At age 30, the response categories for sweets/chocolate were changed so that they matched the response categories for the other three foods.

Data on the four diet indicators, fruit, vegetables, SSBs and confectionery, were analysed at each age to give mean

Across the age range studied we found that mean frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption in this population remained below seven times per week.
