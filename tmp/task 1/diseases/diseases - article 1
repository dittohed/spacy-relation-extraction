Diseases occurences with context:

Patients with pancreatic cancer

X patients with dyslipidemia

The most common cause of death was malignant neoplasms.

X We focused on 32 diseases, including malignant neoplasm and cardiovascular disease, which are potentially associated with a poor vital prognosis.

dyslipidemia was the most common disease

gallbladder/cholangiocarcinoma were the least common disease

pancreatic cancer exhibited the worst prognosis

survival rates for dyslipidemia and prostate cancer were higher than those in the general population

low survival rates for most malignant neoplasms except liver, prostate and breast cancers

longer disease durations were associated with lower survival rates for metabolic diseases: dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus

underlying causes of death in Japan are malignant neoplasm (coded as C00-C97 by ICD-10), cardiovascular disease other than hypertension (I01-02, I05-09, I20-25, and I30-I52), pneumonia (J12-J18), and cerebrovascular disease(I60-69).

malignant neoplasm was the cause of death in 76.8% of subjects with malignant neoplasms

Furthermore, two other chronic diseases, liver cirrhosis and interstitial lung disease/lungfibrosis, were also associated with a poor prognosis

causes of death in all the subjects were malignantneoplasm, cardiovascular disease other than hypertension, pneumonia, and cerebrovascular disease
