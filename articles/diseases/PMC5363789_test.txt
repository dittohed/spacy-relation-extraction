Conclusions
This is the first report to perform follow-up survival analysis across various common diseases. Further studies should use detailed clinical and genomic information to identify predictors of mortality in patients with common diseases, contributing to the implementation of personalized medicine.

The consumption of a more DASH accordant diet is associated with positive health indicators and lowered cardio-metabolic risk [33–35]. The DASH diet assumes that beneficial impact is derived from the overall diet, rather than individual foods or nutrients playing important roles [36]. A DASH score was computed from each participant’s dietary intake using the method developed by Fung et al. [26]. This index includes eight components (one nutrient and seven food groups) based on eating guidance from the United States (US) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute [37]. Scoring is established through quintile rankings, on the basis of relative comparisons to the rest of the sample, with men and women classified separately. Participants are allocated a score from one (lowest quintile) to five (highest quintile) for energy-adjusted intake of: ;;low-fat dairy products;;; ;;whole grains;;; ;;nuts;;, ;;seeds;; and ;;legumes;;; ;;fruit;; (includes ;;fruit juice;;); and ;;vegetables;; (excludes ;;potatoes;;). In contrast, for intakes of ;;red and processed meat;;; ;;sodium;;; and ;;sugar-sweetened beverages;;, participants are allocated a score from one (highest quintile) to five (lowest quintile). Scores are then combined to give a total DASH score, ranging from a minimum of eight to a maximum of 40 points. In this study, DASH scores were standardised using the z-score, to yield a semi-continuous measure of participants’ relative standing.
